# webserv Documentation

webserv is a tool for front-end engineers to rapidly create a development server that supports their development work. It has been made with two main approaches in mind:

* an ad-hoc server that can be started from the command line
* a development server that can be used to quickly scaffold backend services

This documentation describes the way webserv can be used. If you have additional questions, feel free to reach out on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/devpaul/webserv/issues).
