## Testing locally

When working with the CLI it is often desireable to use a local build `webserv`. To build and use the webserv cli locally run:

`npm run build && npm run local`

Command-line attributes can be passed like so:

`npm run local -- -c ./tests/integration/_assets/webserv_config1.json`
